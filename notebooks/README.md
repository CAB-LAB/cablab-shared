# Welcome to shared directory of ESDC Jupyterhub Platform!

In this directory you will find some sample Jupyter Notebooks to give you an idea on what can be done with our datacube.
Please note that this a totally read-only directory because it is strictly a place to share demonstration Notebooks, not some experimental ones.
In order to run a sample Notebook, please follow this instruction:
1. Go to your Jupyter home directory
2. Click New > Terminal
3. To navigate the contents in shared-nb directory, run "ls -l shared-nb"
4. Copy the file using this command "cp shared-nb/<file name to be copied> workspace"
5. Open the Notebook in your personal Jupyter space and feel free to modify and to run it.

NOTE: If you want your notebook to be available in shared-nb, commit it to this repository https://github.com/CAB-LAB/cablab-shared
